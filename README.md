## Introduction

I plan to use React to make a small game/app every week, and I will try my best to keep the code clean and standard. The following ðŸ‘‡ has been completed so far:

| **Game**    | **Progress** | **date**   |
| ----------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Todo        | 100%         | 2020-08-10 |
| TicTacToe   | 100%         | 2020-08-12 |
| 2048        | 100%         | 2020-08-16 |
| AudioPlayer | 100%         | 2020-08-18 |
| ?           | 0%           | ?          |

> you can give me an address about what to make next.

## Quick Start

Require nodejs version > `13.7.0` as config scripts were wrote in es6+, also recommend to use npm to manage project dependencies. After fork the project following below commands to get started.

```bash
  > git clone git@github.com:<your name>/react-game.git
